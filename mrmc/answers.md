1 - In C++, which class methods are automatically generated by the compiler, under what circumstances, and what is their
access protection and signature? Explain why you may or may not want to provide your own implementations of these methods.

constructor destructor and assignment operator methods are auto generated. c++ has 0, 3, 5 rules for their creation.
if you dont implement any of them (0 rule ) compiler will generate all. If you implement any of them you need to 
implement others. they are public and their signatures are standard.

0 rule : all will be generated by compiler 
3 rule: if you implement any of ( ctor, dtor, cop) you should provide others.
5 rule : move assignment and move constructor will be implemented too.

If you implement ctor ( copy constructor) or cop (copy assignment op) compiler will not provide move ones.
if you implement custom ctor etc again compiler will not implement auto ones so simply if you implement custom methods
then you need to follow one of the rules.
